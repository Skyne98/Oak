## Overview

The primary goal is to provide .NET developers the tools to use files as run-time data storage, allowing them to exceed the amount of RAM on the particular machine, on which their program is running. The data can be stored (and manipulated) in file-based arrays, lists, queues, dictionaries and trees.

Also it gives possibilities to split file into dynamically resizable blocks, to maintain different dynamic data structures in one file, which makes the existance of Oak.Core possible.
